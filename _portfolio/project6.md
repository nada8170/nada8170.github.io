The National Forest Park of China is the first UNESCO World Heritage Site in China, known for its towering sandstone pillars. It is preferred to explore it on foot for a unique experience, and when the clouds descend and at sunset you will fully realize why this area was an inspiration for many traditional Chinese paintings."
