Denali National Park is home to the highest peak in North America, and it is one of the quietest places on Earth. The six million acre wilderness provides the perfect opportunity to escape from the hustle and bustle of the world, whether on a mountaineering adventure or a bus ride along Denali Park Road. Plan to visit it in the winter for a chance to see the Northern Lights.
