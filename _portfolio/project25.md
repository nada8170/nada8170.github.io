This monument, which is considered by many to be a monument, was created by erosion factors over thousands of years of rivers and lakes, from carving canyons in rocks, winds and rain, and it was the remnant of the rock formations after all these factors in this large valley in Utah in the southeast of the United States. Monument Valley is the valley of artists who wander, lovers of photography, writing, drawing or photography, and those who love solitude and calm as well because of its charming nature. The valley has gained international fame in cinematic films, as it is considered a wonderful background in filming desert scenes, and the area has been used in many films.
