The sky of the Atacama Desert is the clearest and clearest on the planet! It is the world's number one destination for stargazing, Chile's Atacama Desert is the driest on Earth, which means that clouds are not present, so even without a telescope, you will get wonderful views of the night sky that will take your breath away.
