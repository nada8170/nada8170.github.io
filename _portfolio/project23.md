Horseshoe Bend is located in the Ozark Mountains within the state of Arizona, USA, and the reason for its name is the horseshoe due to its shape that resembles a horseshoe. The horseshoe is one of the natural wonders of the world, as it is located in a whole world of sandstone and red rocks lined with a wonderful art scene overlooking the Colorado River. It is an ideal starting point for visits to Arkansas and the surrounding places that are most attractive to tourists in the state of Arizona.
