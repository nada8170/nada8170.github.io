body:

Known for its rich fossil foundation, the Native Lakota named it for its arid and extreme terrain, it is unlike anywhere else in the United States. The short door path offers wonderful views of the surreal rocky peaks that blanket the landscape. It is possible to camp in it, and watch the sunrise paint the rocks in wonderful colors.
