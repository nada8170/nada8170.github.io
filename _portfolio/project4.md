El Nido Island consists of several islands numbering about 45 islands located in the southeast of the Philippine capital Manila at the northern tip of Palawan Island. The island stretches along the seashore and the buildings on it were designed in a rustic style to suit the nature of the place. Visitors to El Nido Island can practice all tourist and entertainment activities on the island's beautiful beach that inspires vitality and a strong desire to enjoy the magic of the place, as there are water sports such as windsurfing with sailboards, parachutes, jumping in the water, diving and enjoying watching coral reefs and rare species of marine creatures.
