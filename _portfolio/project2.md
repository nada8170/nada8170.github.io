Mount Toubkal is 4,167 meters long, and for that reason it was dubbed "the roof of North Africa". The visitor to this mountain experiences a unique experience, as the road to its winding summit passes empty valleys, sacred shrines from the past, in addition to towering snowfields, and then reaches a series of high hills to give it amazing views incomparable across the Atlas Mountains. It is a peaceful world away from the hustle and bustle of nearby Marrakesh.
