The Maldives is one of the most geographically dispersed regions in the world and the smallest Asian country in terms of population and land area. It is the lowest country on earth. However, more than 80% of the country is made up of atolls that rise less than one meter above sea level. The waters of the Maldives are home to many ecosystems, but they are very well known for the diversity of their colorful coral reefs, and home to more than 1100 species of fish, 5 types of sea turtles, 21 types of whales and dolphins.This unique environment makes it a center of attraction for visitors from all over the world, as tourism in the Maldives is focused on exploring its ecological masterpieces or enjoying one of its luxurious resorts that provide an ideal haven on the shores of the Indian Ocean.
