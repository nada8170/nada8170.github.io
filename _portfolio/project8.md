This park - which was previously named Uluru National Park - contains amazing geological formations that dominate the sandy plain in central Australia. The monumental stone carving in Uluru and the rock domes at Kata Tjuta, West Uluru, are an integral part of the traditional belief system of one of the world's oldest human societies. In addition, the original owners of Uluru-Kata Tjuta Park are the indigenous Anjo.
