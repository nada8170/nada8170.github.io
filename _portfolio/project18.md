Positano is located on the gorgeous Amalfi Coast in Italy, and is one of the most beautiful villages in Europe. It is famous for its wonderful shops and waterside restaurants, not to mention the Byzantine Church of Maria Assunta, which makes it an ideal place for a summer vacation. Make sure to have a unique experience by taking a boat ride from the pebbled beach for gorgeous sunset views.
