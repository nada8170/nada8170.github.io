This city won the title of the most beautiful city in New Zealand 6 times, and it is no wonder that, there are many reasons that always push the front, and perhaps the scent of smart flowers and plants that waft from all the roads, as if someone is perfuming the streets, one of the most beautiful things that you will like over there. The city includes 16 wonderful lakes, all of which were formed from the craters of dormant volcanoes, to add another advantage to this city. If you are lucky enough to visit the lakes, you will find many tourists gathering to enjoy excellent opportunities for fishing for trout.
